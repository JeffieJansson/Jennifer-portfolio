      <h1>Hi there, I’m Jennifer Jansson</h1>
      <p>
       I love bridging the gap between design, data, and technology. 
       I have enjoyed understanding user behavior and uncovering insights, but now I have realized that I don't just want to analyze digital experiences 
       — I want to build them.
      Today, that passion drives me to create intuitive, accessible and meaningful digital products that deliver real value for real users.
